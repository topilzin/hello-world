# hello-world
This is Jimena's first GitHub repository from the tutorial

Now I am making a commit, in order to use this feature for the first time. I am a chemist, educated in Canada and Mexico, and living currently in Germany. I want to learn how to use GitHub to complete my "Data Scientist Toolbox" course on coursera.
